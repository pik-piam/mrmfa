	abstract = {Abstract. Global production of cement has grown very rapidly in
recent years, and, after fossil fuels and land-use change, it is the
third-largest source of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The
availability of the required data for estimating emissions from global
cement production is poor, and it has been recognised that some global
estimates are significantly inflated. This article assembles a large variety
of available datasets, prioritising official data and emission factors,
including estimates submitted to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), plus new estimates for China and
India, to present a new analysis of global process emissions from cement
production. Global process emissions in 2018 were 1.50±0.12 Gt CO2, equivalent to about 4 \% of emissions from fossil fuels.
Cumulative emissions from 1928 to 2018 were 38.3±2.4 Gt CO2,
71 \% of which have occurred since 1990. The data associated with this
article can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.831454

          , 
            Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9\% of which had been recycled, 12\% was incinerated, and 79\% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

	abstract = {Plastics have a broad range of use, but also bring about a variety of environmental implications. China is the world's largest producer and user of plastics, accounting for nearly one-third of the total global flow. Investigating plastic production and use in China is thus critical for developing solutions to promote material circularity and to minimize environmental impacts. We examined five categories of plastics—polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)—which together contribute 74\% of China's total primary plastic consumption. We employed a dynamic model to quantify the material stocks and flows of these five plastics from 1978-2017. The results show that the annual use of these five major plastics increased dramatically from 1 million ton/annual (Mt/a, equivalent to 1 kg/capita) in 1978 to 63 Mt/a (46 kg/capita) in 2017. The in-use plastic stocks were estimated at 305 Mt (219 kg/capita) as of 2017, with 60\% in building and construction sectors. The rapid increase in plastic use generated substantial post-consumer waste flows up to 44 Mt/a in 2017, out of which 26 Mt/a was packaging waste. Over the past 40 years, 29\% of the plastic waste was recycled to produce secondary materials, in comparison to 12\% incinerated, 42\% landfilled, and 17\% discarded without any proper treatment. Policy implications for enhancing plastic recycling are discussed.},
