\title{Calculate kg Co2 emissions generated per one kg of CaO}
\usage{
calcCeCaOEmissionFactor()
}
\description{
Calculates the stoichiometric CO2 emission factor for Calcium Oxide (CaO) production.
}
\details{
The emission factor is derived from the reaction CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2.
Atomic weights are based on IUPAC Conventional Atomic Weights.
- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 15.999 g/mol
- Calcium (Ca): 40.078 g/mol
