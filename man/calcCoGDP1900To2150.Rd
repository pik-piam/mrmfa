\description{
Calc GDP (PPP) from 1900-2150 yearly for the REMIND-MFA format on a country
level. Can be aggregated to regions via calcOutput aggregate parameter.
Uses \link[=readOECD_GDP]{OECD_GDP} for historical GDP data as well as
\link[mrdrivers]{calcGDP} from mrdrivers for current and future GDP data
according to a specific scenario (see \code{vignette("scenarios")}
for more information). Population data from
\link[=calcCoPopulation1900To2150]{calcCoPopulation1900To2150} is used to
convert GDP per capita to total GDP.
GDP is given in 2005 USD (PPP). It's extrapolated to the past with historic
GDP datasets that use a different base year, which however does not matter
as only the relative values are used
(see \link[=toolInterpolate]{toolInterpolate}).
